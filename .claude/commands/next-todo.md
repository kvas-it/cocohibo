Proceed to the next item in TODO.md. Understand what change needs to be made,
which parts of the codebase would be affected. Identify similar pre-existing
features or components that can be reused or adapted. Think what conventions
exist that are relevant to the change. If anything is unclear, ask the user.

Identify possible implementation options and make a technical plan for each
one: what files to change, what commands to run, etc. Present the plans to the
user and ask for choice and confirmation. If there's only one reasonable way to
implement, present just one.

After the plan is confirmed, implement the code, make sure it has test
coverage, run the linter and formatter on the changes. Also make sure the
existing tests pass. Conclude with a summary of the changes made.
